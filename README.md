# Job Search Logger

Job Search Logger is application designed to help keep track of job posting during a job search.

The application allows for roles/job postings to be saved with a status that can be changed as the job search process progresses.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Initial requirements to run the App

This application requires backend and front end applications which are logged in separate repos in GitHub.

This document is part of the frontend:
https://github.com/Nadiafa/job-search-logger-frontend

The  backend lives in:
https://github.com/Nadiafa/job-search-logger-backend

To use the application please clone the repositories and run the servers for both front and backends - they are set to run in ports 3000 and 3001 respectively by default.

## Installation

Clone from Github:
* `$ git clone git@github.com:Nadiafa/job-search-logger-frontend.git`
Execute:
* Run `npm install`
* Run `npm start`
* If not done automatically, open 'localhost:3000' in browser

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
